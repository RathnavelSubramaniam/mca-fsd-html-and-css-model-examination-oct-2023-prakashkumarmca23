                <p>We started in class by zeroing in on the paragraph where Alexie talks about seeing the world in paragraphs.
                     I asked students to define a paragraph in simple writing terms, and we then analyzed each of Alexie’s “levels” of paragraphs.
                      We talked about how his reservation could be a paragraph of the “essay” of the United States, how his house could be one 
                       of the “essay” of his community, how each of his family members could be a single paragraph of the “essay” of his family… We talked about the comparison of a 
                       paragraph to a fence, and concluded that a paragraph break sets boundaries within the essay, marking the end of one idea and the beginning of another.
                </p>
                <p>Alexie’s essay is particularly suited for this discussion because all of its paragraphs fit the standard description. Many other narratives include dialogue or single-sentence
                     paragraphs for effect, and that would confuse the issue with unnecessary complications at this stage.</p>
                <p>After that discussion, we focused briefly on Alexie’s use of the Superman comic, the way he vividly describes a single panel of the comic (Superman breaking down a door) and refers to this image
                     at the end of the essay without actually mentioning Superman. We talked about how a comic strip functions similarly to an essay with paragraph breaks, with each panel serving as its own paragraph. 
                     (You could also argue that each panel is a sentence within the “paragraph” of a page or something similar, but I kept it simple for now.)</p>
